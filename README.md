# 🛫 ALX Travel App 0x00  

This project is part of the **ALX Backend Specialization**.  
It extends the travel booking application by introducing **database models**, **API serializers**, and a **custom seeding command**.  

---

## 📌 Features  

- **Database Models**  
  - `Listing` – Represents properties available for booking.  
  - `Booking` – Represents user bookings linked to a listing.  
  - `Review` – Represents customer feedback for a booking.  

- **Serializers**  
  - Convert Django models (`Listing`, `Booking`) into JSON for API responses using Django REST Framework (DRF).  

- **Database Seeding**  
  - A custom management command `seed` to populate the database with sample data for development and testing.
